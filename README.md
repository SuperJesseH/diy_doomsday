## DIY Doom Index
DIY Doom Index uses macroeconomic, political and environmental data to create a daily index of doom and turmoil. Users can weight and enable provided datasets that will contribute to a calculated doom value. [See working demo here.](https://doom-index.herokuapp.com) (Demo may take a few mins to start up) This front end was built using React, chart.js, JWT and Semantic UI in addition to a number of other packages identified in the yarn.lock file. Data retrieved in the backend from FiveThirtyEight, FRED and NSIDC. [Backend](https://github.com/SuperJesseH/diy_doomsday_backend)
